## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for the stochastic model developed in our study, which explores the evolutionary dynamics of plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free bacterial populations carrying insertion sequences (ISs) under antibiotic selection. The model, based on the Gillespie algorithm, simulates random events of birth, death, mutation (SNPs and ISs), plasmid segregation, and conjugation in a multispecies community competing for a limiting resource.
Simulations explore how the rate of plasmid conjugation and the structure of transmission networks influence plasmid spread, mutation accumulation, and the shift toward IS-driven evolutionary dynamics.

##Notebooks

**MonodGillespieIS_multispecies.ipynb**
Describes the structure of the stochastic multispecies model and provides examples of how individual components (birth, death, conjugation, mutation, segregation) are implemented and interact under resource limitation.

**MonodGillespieIS_parametrization.py**
Uses experimental data of bacterial strains grown in isolation to calibrate strain-specific parameters. This includes fitting Monod growth curves (μₘₐₓ, Kₛ) and estimating antibiotic susceptibility parameters from dose-response experiments.

**MonodGillespieIS_conjugation.ipynb**
Simulates plasmid dynamics in a fully connected plasmid transfer network (complete graph), systematically varying the conjugation rate across several orders of magnitude to identify critical thresholds for plasmid spread and associated changes in mutational spectra.

**MonodGillespieIS_networks.ipynb**
Explores how modifying the structure of the plasmid transfer network (by randomly removing edges) impacts plasmid prevalence, resource competition, and the relative frequency of SNP versus IS mutations.
